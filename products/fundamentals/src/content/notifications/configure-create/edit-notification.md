## Webhooks to external services

There are a variety of services you can connect to using webhooks, in order to receive Notifications from your Cloudflare account. Here are links to some of the most requested services you can connect your Cloudflare account to:

* [Jira](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) 
* [Slack](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
* [GChat](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/webhooks)
* [DataDog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/guide/calling-on-datadog-s-api-with-the-webhooks-integration/)
* [OpsGenie](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/integration-api)

After you are done, you can set up webhooks in your Cloudflare account:

1. In your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login), go to **Notifications > Destinations**. 
1. On the left of your dashboard, click **Destinations** 
1. You will se an area called **Webhooks**. Click the button **Create**.
1. Give your webhook a name so you can identify it later.
1. Fill in the URL you previously set up in the third party service you want to connect your Cloudflare account to â€” for example, Slack.
1. If needed, insert the **secret** in this field. Secrets are how webhooks are encrypted and vary according to the service you are trying to use.
1. Click **Save and test** to finish setting up your webhook.
