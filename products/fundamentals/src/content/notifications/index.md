# Cloudflare Notifications

Cloudflare Notifications help you stay up to date with your Cloudflare account. Manage your Notifications to define what you want to be warned about and how, be it a denial-of-service attack or an issue with your server. 

Notifications are available to anyone with a Cloudflare account. Free plans can set up email-based Notifications. Professional and higher plans can also access PagerDuty. Business and higher plans can also use webhooks.

## Where to find the Notifications section

Notifications are available in your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login). After logging into your account, click Notifications on the top right of the menu in your account home page. Here you can create notifications for different scenarios, edit notifications previously set up and enable or disable notifications.

If you are on a Professional and higher plan, you will also see the tab **Destinations** on the left of the screen, which lets you connect a PagerDuty instance to send your alerts to. 

If you are on a Business and higher plan, in the tab **Destinations** you will also see a Webhooks card where you can connect your Cloudflare account to external services such as Google Chat, Slack and many others.
