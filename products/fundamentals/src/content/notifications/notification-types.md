# What kinds of Notifications are available?

The type of available Notifications depends on your Cloudflare plan. We offer a variety of Notifications for our products and services: Billing, Denial-of-Service protection, Magic Transit, SSL/TLS, and many more.
Depending on your plan, you will also be able to configure webhooks. Webhooks allow you to connect your account with external services such as Slack, Google Chat and others. Another possibility is to use PagerDuty to receive Cloudflare Notifications.
