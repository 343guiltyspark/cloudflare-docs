<Aside type="note">

Client IP Geolocation is different from the <strong>Cloudflare IP Geolocation</strong> setting in the <strong>Network</strong> app. For more details about Cloudflare IP Geolocation — which helps you capture country codes for visitors — see <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200168236">our Support documentation</a>.
